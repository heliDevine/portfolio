            <p>Coding as a career ticks all the boxes I&apos;m dreaming to achieve next. Challenging, interesting, truly global and future-proof field of work and welcoming for beginners like me. I started with a few online courses of HTLM and CSS,  reading articles, blog posts and then found Manchester Codes part-time coding course. I&apos;m now fully hooked and very motivated this is the right path for me.  </p>
