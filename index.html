        <h3> About me</h3>
            <p>Designer, originally from Finland living in Manchester for nearly 20 years in a search for a new direction for my career where I can use my analytical skills and creativity, learn new skills and make the world a bit better place.  </p>
                <p>Coding as a career ticks all the boxes I&apos;m dreaming to achieve next. Challenging, interesting, truly global and future-proof field of work and welcoming for beginners like me. I started with a few online courses of HTLM and CSS,  reading articles, blog posts and then found Manchester Codes part-time coding course. I&apos;m now fully hooked and very motivated this is the right path for me.  </p>
